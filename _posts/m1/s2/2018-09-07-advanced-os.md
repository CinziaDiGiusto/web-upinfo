### Description ###

This class is devoted to master students in computer science.
We will learn some internal concepts on operating systems and their kernels.
The courses will be followed by labs inside machine rooms under Linux.

### Courses ###

- Introduction on Operating Systems and Kernels
- Memory Management
- File Systems
- Processes and Threads


### Exams ###

The evaluation can follow two scenarios, depending on an agreement between the professor and the students:

- scenario 1: a single final exam
- scenario 2: three marks on the lab (50%) + one mark on the final exam (50%)


### Ressources ###

All the material of the courses and labs will be available on our course server: [moodle](https://lms.univ-cotedazur.fr/course/view.php?id=14302).
