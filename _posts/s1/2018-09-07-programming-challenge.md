You could self register by clicking on the link if you are not already registered.

Coding Battle (10%) - October 12, 2022
: A grade is assigned depending on your ranking at the [Coding Battle](https://le-shaker.com/lacodingbattle/). Pair work is allowed.

Coding Battle Oral (40%) - October 17, 2022
: Each student presents a solution to one of the problems given at the [Coding Battle](https://le-shaker.com/lacodingbattle/). Pair work is allowed for problem solving, but the oral is into individual.
{% comment %}
Homework with Sphere Engine (20%) - Released on November 19, 2021
: One problem, prepared at home is submitted during the last lab under teacher supervision. Pair work is allowed.
{% endcomment %}

Final Exam with Sphere Engine (50%) - October 31, 2022
: There are two problems to solve in the labs within 3 hours. Pair work is not allowed.


#### Coding Battle Oral ####

You must present your solution to one of the three most difficult problems of the coding battle.
 - On Thursday, October 13, we will announce which problem you will be asked about.
 - On Monday, October 17, you will submit your final solution in moodle before 8:00 AM.
 - Then, the oral of 20 minutes (in English or French) will be organized in three parts as follows:
     - Algorithmic (7 min): it must include an example of the algorithm execution without any reference to the code.
     - Code (3 min): it describes the implementation choices of your final submission and evaluates its performance.
     - Questions (10 min) about the algorithmic and the code: you can use a whiteboard for answering.
