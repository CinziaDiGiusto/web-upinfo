First, you must masterize the [tutorial]({% post_url ucancode/2019-07-22-tutoriel %}).

Try out one of the problems from the coding battle [Le Shaker in 2019](https://51364960.widgets.sphere-engine.com/lp?hash=rCg1hF4dZ1).

### Grading ###

The [moodle course](https://lms.univ-cotedazur.fr/course/view.php?id=14293) is used for group selection and the grading book.
You should be already registered. Anyway, you could self register by clicking on the link.

Coding Battle Oral (40%) - October 28, 2020
: Each student present a solution one of the problems given at the [Coding Battle](https://le-shaker.com/la-coding-battle-2/). Pair work is allowed for problem solving, but the oral is into individual.

Homework with Sphere Engine (20%) - Released on November 19, 2020
: One problem, prepared at home is submitted during the last lab under teacher supervision. Pair work is allowed.

Final Exam with Sphere Engine (40%) - January 2020
: There are two problems to solve in the labs within 3 hours. Pair work is not allowed.


#### Coding Battle Oral ####

You must present your solution to one of the three most difficult problems of the coding battle.
Note that problems and solutions have been published [here](https://github.com/INSAlgo/coding-battle2020) by the organizers.
We have re-created the judges so that you can easily continue working on the problems.
Some judges have been split in two because of the maximum number of test cases allowed on Sphere Engine.

- d) Damaged ticket: [Judge 1](https://51364960.widgets.sphere-engine.com/lp?hash=zOwV7ZMzmH); [Judge 2](https://51364960.widgets.sphere-engine.com/lp?hash=UqhO9RCUPp).
- e) Cursed Bingo: [Judge 1](https://51364960.widgets.sphere-engine.com/lp?hash=Oi45s0Gdr2).
- f) Merch time: [Judge 1](https://51364960.widgets.sphere-engine.com/lp?hash=aznKyxJx3U); [Judge 2](https://51364960.widgets.sphere-engine.com/lp?hash=cFTGeWvA20).

Let us remark that the statement of the problem f has an error: it indicates that the expected answers are POSSIBLE/IMPOSSIBLE whereas the test cases contain the answers OUI/NON.

Before Monday, October 26, you must select a time slot for your examination on the [moodle course](https://lms.univ-cotedazur.fr/course/view.php?id=14293) as well as your two-persons team if needed.

On Monday, October 26, we will announce which problem you will be asked about.
Your task is to present your own solution to this problem.
Your solution should differ from the public solutions: language; architecture; algorithms; data structures; input/output; any optimization; etc.

On Wednesday, October 28, you will submit your final solution to the judge(s) fifteen minutes before your examination using your official email (etu-univ-cotedazur.fr).
Then, the oral of 20 minutes (in English or French) will be organized in three parts as follows:
- Algorithmic presentation (7 min): your presentation must include an example of the algorithm execution; it must not make any reference to the code.
- Code presentation (3 min): describe the implementation choices of your final submission; compare its performance to the public solutions.
- Questions (10 min) about the algorithmic and the code: you can use a whiteboard for answering.

#### Homework ####

You must submit your solution on sphere engine and moodle before December 6, 2020. <br/>
A short presentation about the homework followed by a Q&A session on Thusrday is scheduled on Thuersday, November 19th at 17:00.
