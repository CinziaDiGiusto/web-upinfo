## Course Objectives

The objectives of the course are to improve your general and professional English level in order to be able to:
  - Introduce yourself at a professional level
  - Write CVs and cover letters in English
  - Attend job interviews in English
  - Present projects and products
  - Communicate efficiently in spoken and written English with correct structure
  - Understand face to face and telephone conversations
  - Read documents or instructions in English and be able to understand them clearly
  - Write emails or handwritten letters with the correct layout
 
## Course Description

The courses will mix different elements. In addition to acquiring or reviewing vocabulary for your professional life, you will also be working on document analysis, structure and grammar exercises, project elaboration and debates. 
Roleplays will allow you to effectively practice your spoken English, and writing will help you improve your English at an academic or professional level.
Of course, the goal is for students to move away from words or structures that are typically word for word translations of French.

## Assessment

You will be assessed as follows:
- 40% of the grade will be presenting a project in class as a group 
- 60% of the grade will be a final assessment (exam)
- Bonuses for participation (penalties as well!)
