This course covers methods and tools for automatically checking whether a system (software or hardware) meets a given specification.

Course program
- The need for formal methods to verify hardware and software systems
- Reactive systems
- The model-checking process and its advantages
- System modeling (Kripke structure)
- Specification modeling (CTL and LTL temporal logics, fairness)
- Model-checking algorithms and their complexity
- Improvements: symbolic model-checking and on-the-fly model-checking
- Realistic examples
