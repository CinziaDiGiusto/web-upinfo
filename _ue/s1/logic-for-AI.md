The objective of this course is to provide a general background in Logic to enable access to more advanced topics in computer science and, more specifically, in artificial intelligence. Intelligent systems in the real world have to deal with issues like uncertainty, imprecision, and incompleteness. Some prominent logical tools that can be used to approach these issues are thus discussed.
