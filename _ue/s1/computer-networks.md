First, networking basics are introduced, paying a special attention to how network services are organize in layers and how these services are implemented by standardized protocols.
Then, the different layers in the protocol stack are explored following a top--‐down approach. Finally, at each layer main protocols, algorithms and mechanisms are detailed.

## Lectures ##
### Part 1:
 - Session 1. INTRODUCTION / APPLICATIONS LAYER.
     - Packet switching, performance (delay, throughput, ...), protocol stack (layers) --‐ Services Application layer.
