logo: "logo_blanc.png"
teaser: "The Internet of Things (IoT)
creates opportunities for more direct integration of the physical
world into computer-based systems, resulting in efficiency
improvements, economic benefits, and reduced human exertions.

This is a true challenge for deployed technologies and sciences.
This course will introduce some issues and candidate solutions from
a software standpoint."

In newspapers, TV news, advertisements, etc., you have certainly
already heard about IoT (Internet of Things) for use cases such that
smartcities, transportation, domotics, energy grids, e-health ...


![IoT HealthCare Use Case]({%include link-asset asset="healthcare.png" %} "HealthCare")


Arguments and presentations on IoT often focus on risks induced by
 deployments and uses : life privacy, infringements to freedoms.

For example, recently you could read that the Smartphone App StopCovid
 was collecting more data than it should.

These are dark sides of IoT, but it should not hide the fact that this
is too a great scientific challenge that could improve and help in
so many domains : ecology, life protection, ...

Futhermore, **IoT could be the next "step" in the evolution of
computing architectures**, generating a disruption wave comparable to
the birth of Internet as a wide public networking in the beginning of
the century.

Such periods always get along with evolutions (or revolutions) of
technologies. Today,

* Networks,
* Programming Languages,
* Databases,
* App Architectures,
* Services ...

are evolving to build the IoT ecosystem : You should be aware !


The following video :  ["An IoT overview ... beyond sensors!"](https://youtu.be/l6bwYSadPTA)

is summerizing the perspective of this course ... but before you can
imagine and contribute to "analytics of things" we have to give some
highlights on IoT and on software components involving in this
context.


We will not talk about more than necessary of hardware and sensors.
But we will talk about evolutions of technologies participating in IoT
:

* Mesh topology,
* Ipv6,
* Low energy connectivity,
* Dynamic Web / Javascript,
* App Deploying,
* NoSQL Databases,
* Edge/Fog/Cloud Computing,
* Dashboard,
* Data analytics/Intelligence/Machine Learning
* ...

As hardware is so cheap, courses will use an ESP32 dev board to make
this teaching as realistic as possible ... knowing that issues and
business come with hundred of ESP ... not with only one device !


### Grading ###
 <!--- - #Modalités de contrôle des connaissances -->
- CCs : Practical courses evaluations
- CT1 : a report (10 pages max) and a prototype running on IoT board based on a
  IoT topic chosen in collaboration with the instructor
- CT2 : a half-hour exam

### Warning ###
This course suppose that attendees like to code. We will use many
languages and paradigms. You are not supposed to know all of them
before the beginning of the course BUT you are supposed to improve
your skills in all of them during practical courses.
If you don't code regularly, it will be difficult to catch the train :-(
