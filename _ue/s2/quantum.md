We introduce the new paradigm of quantum programming and computing through a series of lectures paired with programming labs with the help of a framework which is a `Python` library. Though current quantum computers are not yet powerful, there is a real effort to design frameworks to use them. Our aim is to provide a hands on to build an intuition to use quantum primitives for problem solving with the help of quantum computers.

## Lectures

* Introduction to quantum computing (I): refresher on mathematics and computer science theory for quantum computing, short introduction to quantum physics, qubit notion
* **Lab**: hands on `Jupyter` and QC framework. Basic quantum operations, visualisation and measuring  
* Introduction to quantum computing (II): quantum circuits, difference between an adiabatic machine and a real quantum computer, applications of quantum computing (like quantum key distribution)
* **Lab**: Quantum Key distribution
*  First general quantum algorithms (QFT and Grover)
* **Lab**: Quantum search with Grover's algorithm and application in computer science
* Famous quantum algorithms: Simon and Shor 
* **Lab**: Quantum programming of Simon's and Shor's algorithms

  ## Prerequisities ##
==============

-   Undergraduate mathematics (linear algebra, complex analysis, calculus,
     probability theory).

-   `Python` programming and use of libraries. The use of `Jupyter` is
    a plus.
