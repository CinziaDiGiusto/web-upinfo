### TO DO before the start of the lectures
All students have to choose their **optional** courses for the first semester **before** the start of the lectures!

- The number of places for each cours is limited and based on a first come first served policy.

- Each student has to carefully study the [syllabus of the courses](../../master/liste/) and the schedule below (to check which are the courses that happen in parallel).

- Students of the M1 Informatique have to choose between 8 and 10 courses.

- Students of the M1 Informatique parcours Intelligence Artificielle have to choose between 4 and 6 courses.

If you have questions on the courses:
- in the syllabus you have the contact email of the professor giving the cours,
- ask your question on our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/GyQBYrNybF).
